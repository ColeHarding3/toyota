    I will attempt to create an API that tracks turtle movements even when the
    turtle is moving while the game shuts down or whatever. I will use fuel
    for directional moving, and some kind of backtracking for rotation.

    The API is relatively basic, in that it is purely focused on movement. It's
    essentially a rich drop-in replacement for the the original navigational
    functions in the turtle API:
        turtle.forward   -> toyota.forward
        turtle.back      -> toyota.back
        turtle.up        -> toyota.up
        turtle.down      -> toyota.down
        turtle.turnRight -> toyota.turnRight
        turtle.turnLeft  -> toyota.turnLeft

    When using this API, you must not use any other functions that alter
    the turtle's position or facing. In particular:

        DO NOT USE turtle.forward, turtle.back, turtle.up, turtle.down,
        turtle.turnRight or turtle.turnLeft NOR THEIR NATIVE EQUIVALENTS.

    Any other external force changing the turtle's position will also
    invalidate the coordinates, of course (such as the player pickaxing the
    turtle and placing it somewhere else or RP2 frames).

    This was inspired by LAMA - Location Aware Movement API - 2013 Sangar
